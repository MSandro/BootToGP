# BootToGP
## Welcome to BootToGP, the first OS which let you GP projects boot!


BootToGP is a simple Debian based networkinstaller which brings all you need to run GP projects. The installation process is easy and only takes about 15 minutes, but it depends on your internet connection.


## About the OS
Os-Base: Debian 9.5 (Netinstaller)
Display-Server: Xorg
Login-Manager (DM): none
Window-Manager: Fluxbox
SSH & SFTP: enabled
Default GP Edition: GPower (by MSandro)


## How to use v001
Version 001 is the first public Beta release of BootToGP. It only features a minimum of software to run GP projects. It comes with the latest version of GPower. This modified version of GP has some extras which are needed to correctly display the projects after boot. GPower features an settings file and menu to control the stage resolution and some other things. Specially for BootToGP I've implemented an Embed-Mode. If this is set to true, GP will automatically start the given project which can be defined in an separate string value.
v001 is currently only working on 32 and 64 bit processors. An Respberry Pi edition is development.
